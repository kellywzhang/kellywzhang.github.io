## Introdution

Real-world decision-making requires grappling with a perpetual lack of data as environments
change; intelligent agents must comprehend uncertainty and actively gather information to resolve
it. This is especially challenging with tasks involving neural networks that learn representations
of unstructured inputs such as text and images. This paper offers a fresh perspective, casting the
problem of balancing exploration and exploitation in online decision-making as a problem of train-
ing and sampling from an autoregressive generative sequence model, an area experiencing rapid
innovation

We present our insights by deriving a novel solution to a meta-bandit problem, in which an agent repeatedly encounters new tasks that require exploring to
gather useful information. In real applications this meta-learning structure is common, e.g., in
recommendation systems where new items are continually released, and personalized user experi-
ences consistently have new individuals who enter the system. We illustrate our approach using a
news article recommendation setting as a concrete example. Each day a batch of new articles is
released, and upon release, the recommendation agent observes each articleâ€™s text but is uncertain
about how engaging each article will be, as some articles may be surprise hits, or others may be
less popular than one would expect. Although article headlines provide a useful early indicator of
article performance, models that solely rely on such features will eventually be outperformed by

## Equation
This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
