##### **Join the group!**

- **PhD Applicants:** If you are interested in doing a PhD with me, feel free to reach out to me. There are a variety of routes to doing a PhD:
    - [StatML Center for Doctoral Training](https://statml.io/)
    - [Math Department](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/postgraduate/doctoral-programme/)
    - There are also other centers for doctoral training on [AI4Health](https://ai4health.io/) and [Collaborative Computational Modelling at the Interface](https://ccmi-cdt.org/), which I may be able to admit students from. 
- **Imperial Msc Students:** If you are interested in doing a masters thesis project with me, reach out. I am advising masters students in multiple programs including I-X, statistics, and computing.
- **Imperial Undergrads:** If you are an Imperial undergrad interested in working with me, send me an email with your resume, transcript, links to any projects you've worked on, and a paragraph about your interests. I also recommend looking into the [UROP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/) program. 
- **Postdocs:** Postdoc funding opportunities are currently more limited, so I would encourage looking into [Schmidt AI in Science Fellowsips](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ix-ai-in-science/-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-ai-in-science-global-faculty-fellowships/), as well as external fellowships.

Here is the [learning agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xCyEq06xDTI5MjzY4eUt6UVT6Oz-ChvOuWZyBD5EqFo/edit?usp=sharing) I use with students.

##### **Possible project directions**
I am interested in designing methods for real-world decision-making problems. I'm particularly interested in decision-making in environments that are stochastic and lack accurate mechanistic models of the environment (like healthcare, recommendation systems, social sciences---in contrast to video games and robotics). Some directions I'm currently particularly interested in:
- Using [foundation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04129) and pretraining techniques on historical data for more efficient exploration, decision-making, and policy improvement. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07064) for our initial efforts in this direction. I'm particularly interested in exploring if these methods can be used in [small data settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12031).
- Collaborating with organizations interested in using decision-making algorithms. I recently started working with American Express and [neonatal care physicians](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/about-us/involving-and-engaging-patients-and-the-public/get-involved/your-data-in-action/the-national-neonatal-research-database-making-faster-safer-and-more-efficient-improvements-to-neonatal-healthcare/).
